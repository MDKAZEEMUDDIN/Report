In Acceleration period I have complited few of topics:-
1)Familiarize Visual Studio
->It is used for develop computer program,websites,Desktop Application,and Mobile Application
2)Feature of Visual Studio
->code Editor

->Other Tool
3) Tools like :-
*)open Browser Tab
*)object brower
4)Difrence between .Net and .Net core
5)Command line palette
The foremost necessary key combination to graps is ctrl+shift+p that brings up the command palette
6).Net Two components 
*)common Language  runtime(CLR)
*)class libray which includes code for all major areas of application development
7)compiled Vs interprited langauge 
8)Win forms:-This used for developing form based application which would run on end user machine
9)Basic codes of git

10)Functions
A function is a group of related instructions that performs a specific task.
->Types of Functions in C#:
->Basically, there are two types of Functions in C#. They are as follows:
*)Built-in Functions
*)User-Defined Functions
11)Call by Value and Call by Reference in C#
 ->In.NET Framework by default all the objects are called by value, not called by reference. 
 whether it is a Value Type Primitive data types like:- int, char, double, etc.or Reference Data Type :-class, interface, delegate, string, etc
they are by default going to be called by value.
12)Static and non static keyword
13)we override the Equals() method of the Object class inside the Customer class When overriding the Equals() method 
make sure the passed object is not null and can be cast to the type you are comparing 
When overriding Equals() you also need to override GetHashCode() otherwise you will get a compiler warning.
14)Convert.ToString and ToString Method 
Both these methods are used to convert a value to a string The difference is Convert.ToString() method handles null
and the ToString() doesnâ€™t handle is null
15)Check and unchecked keywords
16)Stack and Heap memory
17)Boxing and Unboxing
